Ummmm....started out my career working at startups as a developer and architect.

Then fell into marketing and have been focused on that for the last 15+ years. Have worked on marketing B2B SaaS platforms, developer tools, and API/SDKs.

Big into open source. Was the [first Ubuntu Hall of Famer](https://fridge.ubuntu.com/2008/11/20/ubuntu-hall-of-fame/) way back when.
